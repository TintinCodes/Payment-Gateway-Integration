This is one of my tasks for the GRIP internship The Sparks Foundation. In which I have to include the payment gateway for the donation button. On clicking the donation button the third party payment gateway window will pop-up which is having multiple payment options ranging from internet banking to card payment. After the successful transfer an invoice will be generated and it will be mailed to you on the provided mail id. Here  I have included Razorpay.
